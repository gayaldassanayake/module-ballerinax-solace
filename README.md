## Overview

[Solace PubSub+](https://docs.solace.com/) is an advanced event-broker platform that enables event-driven communication across distributed applications using multiple messaging patterns such as publish/subscribe, request/reply, and queue-based messaging. It supports standard messaging protocols, including JMS, MQTT, AMQP, and REST, enabling seamless integration across diverse systems and environments.

The `ballerinax/solace` package provides APIs to interact with Solace PubSub+ brokers through the JCSMP API. It allows developers to programmatically produce and consume messages, manage topics and queues, and implement robust, event-driven solutions that leverage Solace’s high-performance messaging capabilities within Ballerina applications.

## Examples

The `ballerinax/solace` package provides practical examples illustrating its usage in various real-world scenarios. Explore these [examples](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/module-ballerinax-solace/tree/main/examples) to understand how to produce, consume, and reliably process messages with a Solace event broker.

1. [Order Fulfillment](examples/order-fulfillment/Order%20Fulfillment.md) - Send orders to a queue and process them with `CLIENT_ACK` mode, so a worker that crashes before acknowledging a message picks it back up on restart.

2. [Live Price Alerts](examples/live-price-alerts/Live%20Price%20Alerts.md) - Publish stock price updates to hierarchical topics and raise alerts only for significant moves, using a topic wildcard and direct (at-most-once) delivery.

3. [Transactional Inventory Sync](examples/transactional-inventory-sync/Transactional%20Inventory%20Sync.md) - Apply inventory deltas from a queue within a transacted session, rolling back and safely discarding a bad update instead of corrupting inventory state.

4. [Payment Processing](examples/payment-processing/Payment%20Processing.md) - Reject an invalid payment outright while retrying one that hits a simulated transient failure, using negative acknowledgement (`nack`) with and without requeueing.

## Build from the source

   > **Note:** After installation, remember to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the directory where JDK was installed.

2. Download and install [Ballerina Swan Lake](https://ballerina.io/).

3. Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

   > **Note**: Ensure that the Docker daemon is running before executing any tests.

4. Export Github Personal access token with read package permissions as follows,

    ```bash
    export packageUser=<Username>
    export packagePAT=<Personal access token>
    ```
