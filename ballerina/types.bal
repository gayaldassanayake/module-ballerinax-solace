# The Solace service type attached to a `solace:Listener` for asynchronous (push-based) consumption.
#
# An attached service must declare a remote `onMessage` method and may optionally declare an
# `onError` method. The accepted signatures are:
# ```ballerina
# remote function onMessage(record {|*solace:Message; T payload;|} message) returns solace:Error?;
# remote function onMessage(record {|*solace:Message; T payload;|} message, solace:Caller caller) returns solace:Error?;
# remote function onMessage(solace:Message message) returns solace:Error?;
# remote function onError(solace:Error err) returns solace:Error?;
# ```
# Declaring a narrowed `payload` type (`T`) causes the message payload to be data-bound into that
# type; declaring the base `solace:Message` type yields the raw payload as `anydata`.
# The subscription (queue or topic) and flow options are supplied via the
# `@solace:ServiceConfig` annotation on the service.
